# PianoGraph 🎹
PianoGraph is an educational hardware device designed to assist beginners in learning to play the piano. Developed as a final thesis project for the Electronic Engineering degree in 2017, PianoGraph combines visual guidance and real-time feedback to enhance the learning process.
The system works by illuminating the keys a user should press, effectively acting as a visual tutor. This allows learners to associate musical notes with their physical positions on the keyboard, helping bridge the gap between reading sheet music and hand coordination.
PianoGraph was designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind, offering an intuitive interface and support for various practice modes. It aims to make learning the piano more engaging, effective, and fun.

## 📌 Features

- LED indicators above each key for real-time guidance  
- MIDI file support for learning actual songs  
- Multiple learning modes (note-by-note, tempo control, etc.)  
- Simple and intuitive user interface  
- Designed for acoustic and digital pianos  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Microcontroller-based hardware  
- MIDI protocol for song input  
- LED driver circuits  
- Embedded C/C++  
- App for song management  

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load a MIDI song file onto the app.  
2. PianoGraph analyzes the notes and lights up the corresponding keys.  
3. The learner follows the lights and plays the notes.  
4. Optional feedback features track progress and accuracy.
